<td><h1>Foreword</h1>
This second volume in the book collection <i>Sami school history</i> is, similar to <a href="ssh1-e.htm">the first volume</a>, a collection of articles, stories, memories and documents from different sides of the school for Sami pupils and students. It is published as a book and an online version, at the address <a href="https://divvungiellatekno.github.io/skuvla"> <b> https://divvungiellatekno.github.io/skuvla</b></a>, at the same time. The online version has more or less the same contents as the book, but also a few more pictures.</p>
<p>This book is a result of collaboration between many people and institutions. We would like to profoundly thank everyone who has given their contributions and made it possible for this book to be published; authors, narrators, translators, proofreaders, photographers, artists, the staff at the publisher and libraries, archives, museums and schools. Last but not least we would like to thank the institutions who have contributed in financing the publishing of this volume. They are listed at the back of the book.</p>
<p>With this volume we wish to map what the sami pupils have experienced in Norwegian schools. The map still have some blank spots, and only with help from our readers are we able to fill them. We are still interested in stories and documents for later volumes.</p>
<p>We are also interested in corrections and further particulars to this volume. Changes will in that case be made in the online version and in later editions of the book.</p>
<p>If you have any contributions, please contact the publisher:<br>
