I graduated the student line at Volda teacher's college in 1951. During
the last half year there were lots of talk about where we'd like to
apply for a job. After 14 years of school we were very motivated to
start working - and to earn money. I was completely sure where I'd like
to
work - in the north of the country, in Finnmark. I had read a lot about the
evacuation and burning of that part of the country that took place in
the autumn and
winter of 1944.
</p>

<h3>Meeting Polmak boarding school</h3>

In the end of July I
received a trunk call from the school authorities in Polmak asking if I
in addition to a full teaching position would take on the post as
manager of the boarding school. I accepted the offer there and then.
Furthermore they asked me if I would be able to come earlier, in order
to
spend a few days with the former manager to learn about the practical
tasks in the boarding school. And that's why I arrived in Polmak just a
few days later. It wasn't easy to get there. There was no road, so for
the last 15 kilometres we had to make use of a river boat. That's where
I had my first encounter with the language problems. To put it mildly
the boatman knew very little Norwegian.

<p> The boarding school was an impressive building. With its three
floors on a high foundation wall it really stood out in the landscape.
The house was finished in 1938 and had survived both the war and the
burning in 1944. There weren't any electricity in the village, but the
boarding school had its own generator named Sakkeus. I don't know why.
In the room next to the generator there was a room with accumulators.
The system was made for the generator to charge the batteries. When
they were fully charged we would have enough electricity for the
classrooms, the dormitories and for the other rooms in the house, but
not for cooking and heating. I soon realized that the maintenance of
Sakkeus and the accumulators would be one of the main tasks in my
position as manager of the boarding school. </p>

<p> The buildings were more than 15 years old, and quite
run-down. There shouldn't be spent money on anything, because the
village was waiting for electricity. Kraftlaget (an electricity
company) had already started setting up poles both for high-voltage and
energy distribution network. The boarding school had a system of
central heating, which could be heated both with firewood and coke.
When we heated with firewood I had to get up at a certain time during the night
to fill the stove, otherwise there would be no hot water in the
morning, and cold dormitories and classrooms. Coke was transported to
the school when the ice on the river Tana was solid. </p>

<p> People from the neighborhood were hired to chop firewood and
do other kinds of work that could be dangerous. The pupils had the
responsibility to pile the firewood and make sure there were always
enough firewood in the kitchen and in the boiler room. I can't remember
whether there were problems linked to this job. As in any other home it
was natural that the children helped out with odd jobs. I was used to
this from back home in the farm where I grew up. </p>

<h3>Sami teacher wasn't desired</h3>

The school schedule was organized in periods of six weeks. The 8
classes we had were split into two groups. While one of the groups was
at home for six weeks, the other was in school. After this period they
would swap. This was approximately like the national school system,
with teaching every second day. We were four teachers in full
positions. I was the only one with a pedagogical education. In the
boarding school there were also a house keeper and two maids. One of
the maids was a Sami girl from the village. She was the one I turned to
when I came across matters related to Sami in my work. The house keeper
didn't speak Sami.
<p>We were one teacher short just before the school started. The school
council made the superintendent of schools aware that there was a young
person in the village who spoke Sami and who would like to be a teacher
in the school. He was a student with a couple of years experience as a
teacher. But the superintendent of schools turned down the proposition.
And a young female student from Oslo arrived a few days later. She had
just finished her upper secondary school exam in the spring, and didn't
speak any Sami of course. This shows how the school politics in the
Sami area was in those days. All teaching should be held in Norwegian.

<p>Quite a few of the youngest pupils understood little of the
teaching. The situation was a little bit better in the upper primary
school (4th
to 7th grade<strong>), </strong>but also among those pupils there
lacked a
lot in the comprehension of Norwegian. And it was the same for the
adult segment of the population. A self-experienced story sheds light
on this: The school board decided unanimous that sexual education
should be given in the 7th grade. I was to teach the boys, while the
oldest of the female teachers would teach the girls. We had gotten hold
of the illustration charts which were to be used. I had gotten an
introduction to the subject in the teachers college. We made a
straightforward plan for the teaching together, and were of the opinion
that we had done an acceptable piece of work. But after some time we
learned that there was a petition circling in the village to stop this
teaching. One day I met one of the people who had signed - who also was
a member of the school board - and I asked him why he had signed. Was
it our way of teaching the subject which was the problem? No, he
answered. They just didn't understand the expression sexual education. </p>

<p> The Sami ABC-book of Margarethe Wiig wasn't put out until in
the 50s. In the beginning of the book the Sami text was on the first
page, followed by the Norwegian on the facing page. The two languages
had different colours. Later in the book the two languages appeared on
the same page, and became less separated. And in the end of the books
there were coherent texts in Sami and Norwegian, but still divided by
colours. I know that the book has been published in several editions.
And I suppose it is a sign that Sami should be used as an auxiliary
language. </p>

<h3>DDT against lice</h3>

<p>The hygiene was an important part of the job. One afternoon every
week we had bathing day with sauna and shower. I was responsible for
the boys, meanwhile the housekeepers were to help the girls. After the
bath all the pupils had to go through a scrutiny of the hair in order
to discover lice. Some students had gotten lice at home. The ones who
had lice were given a sprinkle of DDT-powder in the hair and in the
underwear. The bedlinnen were also sprinkled with this powder. We got
loads of 10 kilos at a time from the pharmacy in Vadsø. Now it's
completely prohibited to use DDT in any kind of situation, but at the
time it was an effective remedy against lice. I can still recall the
particular smell of this powder. We sensed it everywhere in the house.
At that time I was the most visited hairdresser in the village. The boys should have an "american" haircut. They didn't quite
know what it implied, but I showed them pictures of american soldiers
which were quite close-cropped. The girls had long hair, which could be
problematic. When they combed their hair a lot of hair ended up in the
sink and blocked the drain. For this reason, and also for hygienic
reasons, we encouraged the girls to have shorter hair, but they weren't
too keen on the idea.</p>

<h3>Low budget for food</h3>

Polmak was a governmental boarding school, which entailed that
everything concerning the running of the boarding school was
administrated by the superintendent of schools in Vadsø. Everything
concerned the running of the school was administrated by the school
board in the commune. Therefore I had two employers, since I was
manager of both the boarding school and the school. I was surprised
that in the important work as manager of the boarding school I didn't
get any introduction to the work. The demand was that we had to have
pedagogical education. Some days before the students arrived in the
school, I went to the office of the superintendent of school and
greeted Harald Lunde. He gave me some advices on how to deal with
money, balance sheets and such things. I had to keep copies of all
correspondance, but he didn't have the means to give me a typewriter.
Therefore I bought a typewriter on my own.
<p> There were a lot of governmental boarding schools in Finnmark.
All of them had a housekeeper who were responsible for the food and
the food budget. It was a matter of honor to them to run the boarding
school with as low costs as possible. The superintendent of schools
made sure we all got to know the diet cost per pupil per day. And the
one who was able to run at the lowest cost was praised. This could
give comic outcomes: We were four adults and a child who were staying
in the boarding school over Christmas. I thought we could buy some
Christmas sweets, like we were used to. But the house keeper said no
- it would make the food budget rise too much. Instead I placed the
extra expenses for the Christmas sweets on the maintenance budget which
I was responsible for.
</p>

<p> The daily diet was simple. The pupils ate a lot, and seldom
complained. There were still rations for a lot of foodstuffs, but we
managed well. At times there was a lack of milk. There wasn't any
delivery of milk to the dairy, and therefore the farmers didn't produce
more than they would use for themselves. But we bought sacks of dry milk
and made hot cocoa.
</p>

<p>For breakfast we would eat sandwiches and drink milk or hot cocoa.
And after the third lesson we would have the same meal. Dinner was served
just after the school finished for the day. It consisted of soup or meat
or fish in different variations. The pupils had to take cod liver oil
in the winter months. It was always a big mess. So we came up with the
idea of putting the bottle with cod liver oil on the dinner table, so
the pupils could use the cod liver oil as "sauce" on the fish. It went
well. And then we would eat a slice of bread or two before we started to
do homework at five. The supper was served just after we had
finished with the homework, it could for instance consist of reheated leftovers
from dinner. The diet was simple, but it was also healthy and
nutritious. And it has to be viewed in the light of the system of
rations, the fact that the village didn't have any road and the limited
economy. In the winter we bought a lot of reindeer meat. And in the
summertime we got hold of cheap salmon from time to time. And generally
we bought barrels of salted fish. Vegetables were difficult to get hold
of. And that was possibly the greatest lack - at least for me. </p>

<h3>Sun time and normal time</h3>

The Sami people didn't live by the clock. We had two times to stick to
- sun time and normal time. In East Finnmark the day starts more than one
hour earlier compared to the more central parts of the country.
Therefore it was natural that the daily life followed the sun time. In
posters normally both sun time and normal time would be written. The
school used the sun time. It gave us a relatively long afternoon. I
remember that the students used their time off well. In the winter we
went skiing a lot. The ones who had skis at home brought them to
school. The school were also given ten pairs of skis from the
"association for the promotion of the skisport" (I think the
association was called that). We built a skiing hill close to the
school. We
also put up a couple of lightbulbs in order to be able to make use of
the hill in the dark season. Besides we had a relatively good square at
the school, with room for various games. And we had the Tana river and
the nature around us. In the autumn we went out to pick berries. The
berries were also a popular supplement to the diet.
<p> The time between supper and bedtime was also a nice time for
activities inside. We had a choir in the school. The pupils liked, and
were also good at singing. They never brought radios. Very few homes
had a radio in those days. We sang in the church during a funeral once.
One of the pupils died in the period he was at home, and the parents
wanted us to sing. It was a good way - also for the students - to say
goodbye to a friend and schoolmate.
</p>

<p> Between five and seven o'clock everyone had to do their
homework. One of the teachers had to be present in order to keep order,
and to help the ones who needed it. Everyone had to
stay inside these two hours, and there were no exeptions. The ones who finished their homework early
got other things to do. There were a lot of pupils who needed help. As
far as I remember the older pupils were very good at helping the
younger ones. In particular I recall a girl in the seventh grade who
had two younger siblings in the boarding school. She was like a mother
to them. And it could admittedly be needed. I vividly recall the crying
of the first graders when they stood there alone after their parents
had left. But luckily we had Sami maids who could talk to them in a
language they understood. But what was it like to be teaching these
children who didn't understand the language which was used for
teaching? Quite a few pupils talked and understood both Norwegian and
Sami. They were often used as translators. One had to make use of all
the pedagogical remedies one knew. And it also happened that one had to
make use of untraditional methods. </p>

<p> In the spring and the autumn we had a problem when the ice on
the river Tana was unsafe to travel on. The village Polmak was on the
opposite side of the river to the school and the boarding school. And
during this times of the year the pupils from the village had to live
in the boarding school. It was impossible to predict for how long we
would be isolated. We had to keep plenty of food. We weren't able to go
to the shop, post-office or the communal offices. When the ice was safe
in the autumn, or when it had melted in the spring, life returned to
normal again. It was a celebration for the whole district when the ice
melted in the spring. It meant that they were able to take out the
boats, and soon the salmon would come! In the school we were always
eager to know if the river would be trafficable before the 17th of May
letting the whole village community be able to celebrate the day
together.
</p>

<p> What did we adults do in our spare time? The district sheriff and
his wife were interested in music, and they put together a kind of
quartet. We took a lot of delight in it. The district sheriff himself
played the accordion, mandolin and trumpet. His wife played the guitar.
In addition the administrator at the cooperative shop played the
accordion, and I played the guitar. We made our first appearance in the
parade the
17th of May. As far as I remember we used to play at dances in private
festivities. Otherwise there was a vivid bridge circle in the village.
We were 16 players divided in four tables. I was a beginner in this
field, but I had a patient and good partner. It was good fun and very
social.
</p>

<h3>Harassment in Sami </h3>
The pupils who were living in the
boarding school came from all over the commune except Sirma, where they
had their own school and boarding school. The pupils were living close
together both day and night. Usually they went home for the weekends.
The younger ones were accompanied by the older children. And often the
parents would come to pick them up. But it happened that the weather
was so bad that the children had to stay in the boarding school. Where
many children are gathered over a longer period of time, it often
happens that teasing (bullying), pushing and fighting take place. It
wasn't easy for us grown ups to go into the conflicts, because all the
oral harassment happened in Sami. For all we knew, we could be harassed
in a language we didn't understand. Neither were we able to understand
when the pupils used an abusive language at each other. But the body
language often told more than words. The problem is that the victim
doesn't want - or dare - to seek help from parents or teachers. And the
bully is let off. When a grown up enters to mediate, all parties
answers in unison: "It's just a game". Also the victim says so,
although the body language says the exact opposite.

<p> The position at the boarding school in Polmak was my first after
completing my education. I didn't have the practical experience to
handle the problems which could occur. Now, after more than 40 years of
experience from 1rst to 10th grade, I'm able to see things in a
different way. A boarding school was a new concept to me. I didn't see
any other option either in a commune without roads. It was too far for
the pupils to walk. I know that in some sparsely populated areas they
made use of private accommodation. It was probably never an alternative
in Polmak. I guess one should be allowed to say that a boarding school
was the best solution in order to be able to give the children an
approximately normal schooling. </p>
