<td><h1>Foreword</h1>
<h4 align=center>English translation: Simon Aldridge</h4>
Sami school history is the story of the Sami pupils’ encounter with a school of
which they knew little or nothing, of parents distraught over having to send
their children into an unknown environment at the age of seven and of teachers
who shared no common language with their pupils.<p>
	It is also the story of how Sami teachers, parents, pupils and
politicians have fought for a school based on the pupils’ own language and
culture. It is the story of the authorities’ stubborn attempts, for a century or
more, to wipe out the Sami language and culture, of the efforts, in more recent
times, to use school as a means of revitalizing the Sami language and culture in
heavily norwegianized areas, and much, much more.<p>
	This book is a result of a co-operation between very many people. We would therefore like to offer our heartfelt thanks to the writers, storytellers (sources), translators, proof-readers, photographers and artists employed by the publisher.
	We would also like to thank all the library, archive, museum and school
staff who have helped us find material and not least the institutions whose
financial contributions have helped us get the book published. They are
acknowledged at the back of the book.<p>
	Sami School History is intended to be a work in several volumes and we hope to be able to publish a book a year for the next few years. 
The publisher and editorial committee are interested in contacting anyone who
can contribute additional information, corrections, accounts, documents or
photographs that we can use in later volumes. <p>
	If you have anything to contribute, you are welcome to contact the publisher:
