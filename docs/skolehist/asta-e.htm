<h3>Norwegian at a 'good morning'-level</h3>
At home we only spoke Sami, but at school, everything should be in
Norwegian. My first teacher was Anna Mørk. She taught in Karasjok for a
long time, and she had also been my mother's teacher. She was
Norwegian, but she knew Sami. I remember the first day at school, when
she asked how many of us knew Norwegian. I raised my hand, because I
could say "God dag!" (Good morning!). Then I helped my cousin, who sat next to me, to
raise her hand, because I knew that she knew just as much Norwegian as
I did. The truth was that none of us knew much more than these two
words. Anna Mørk mainly taught in Norwegian, but she explained to us in
Sami when we did not understand. Because of that it became easier for
us to understand the first years in school, and later, when we had
other teachers, who were not proficient in Sami, we had already begun
to understand Norwegian.
<p>As we were always supposed to speak Norwegian in class, schooling
did not improve our proficiency in our native language. On the
contrary, our native tongue was weakened at the dormitory, because we
only heard Sami spoken by children at the same age, and thus our
development of Sami stagnated at that stage. In my environment back
home, Sami had a strong position, and when we came home, our parents
would correct our language. I still remember their advices, and how
they over and over again referred to that "in Sami we do not talk like
this, but like this".

<h3>School strike </h3>
I had to live at the dormitory through the 9 years of primary school. The first time I lived at the school's dormitory in
Karasjok, at the church site. We went home every Saturday, and even
though we had to walk pretty far, because the bus only drove half the
distance, it was always good to be home for a night.

<p> When I was in 3rd grade, it was decided that the children from the
outskirts should go to Grensen school, a school located 20 km in the
opposite direction of the church site. This more than doubled the
distance back to our homes, and we could only go home barely once a
month. My father was in the local council and he tried to counteract
this politically, but he did not succeed, and then he and some other
parents went out on strike. They kept their children home for three
weeks. All the parents did not join in on the strike. Many people were
short of money, and some parents had calculated that they could save a
bagful of flour if the children did not come home that often.
</p>
<p> At Grensen dormitory we lived 6 girls in one room. I remember the
first day at school when my sister and I took out our clothes from the
clothing-box our dad had made, and placed everything neatly in the
closet. While we were away, our new roomies had thrown our things
pell-mell around the room. This is probably the worst welcoming I have
ever received. The children were often left to themselves, free to
exclude others when no adults were around. I was a different child.
When the other children played, I read books and I read everything in
the school library. Ever since I began to understand Norwegian, I was
interested in reading and I read all sorts of literature.

<h3>Skillful teachers</h3>
I went to Grensen school for 3 years and I was content with the teachers; Trygve Madsen and his wife, Randi<a href=#[2]>[2]</a>,
Inger Johanne Kåven and Rolf Presthus. I particularly remember Randi Nordback Madsen, whom I learned a lot from. She was my teacher in the
6th grade at Grensen school, and later also my teacher in parts of upper primary school (7th-9th grade) at the church site.

<p> In 7th grade my teacher was Inez Boon and she was a skillful teacher. At that time I had no idea what an important role she had in
the creation of elementary courses in Sami.<a href=#[3]>[3]</a>
When I studied in Oslo I met her again, and at that time she worked at
the Universitetsforlaget (Scandinavian University Press). Our teachers
in the first part of secondary school were overall skillful and had
higher education. Among them was Inger Sophie Bolstad, the priest's
wife. The priest, Jo Bolstad, created a good and positive environment
for the young people, and he was regarded as the priest of the youths.
Among other things, he wrote a play with us, and it was staged at
the Sami folk high school<a href=#[4]>[4]</a>, and many people came to see the show. My parents were also there, even my
grandmother who was a laestadian (a pietistic revival movement) and
did not like theatre very much. Everything went alright until a youth
came up on stage and played Jesus: my grandmother jumped up from the
bench, left the room and did not return.
</p>
<p> I spent the first years in primary school learning Norwegian. I
worked hard with it, and my knowledge in the other subjects were rather
poor. I often came home with the lowest grade in subjects such as
mathematics, history and science. My grades did not improve until I
reached 5th-6th grade, and my proficiency in Norwegian had become
rather good. In 8th grade I had a classmate from Kongsberg (her father
came as a captain to the military base Porsangmoen) and that became
useful to me. They spoke Norwegian with a southern accent, as did the
teachers, and by copying them I learned that accent too. When I
graduated from the first part of secondary school, I received top
grades in Norwegian. I even did better than many of my Norwegian class
mates! It was satisfying to see that all the hard work had finally
payed off.
</p>
<p> When I chose the theoretic course of study in the 8th grade, all my
former class mates chose the practical course, and thus I became the
only one left, at my age, in the dormitory. My new class mates lived in
private flats at the church site. They came from other places like
Kautokeino and Porsanger. The life at the secondary school's dormitory
was not so bad. I had grown used to it, and I had also grown up myself.
The only negative aspect of life at the dormitory was curfew hours. We
had to be back by 9 p.m. When we had a lot of homework at school, I
could barely make time to hang out with my classmates. My father wanted
me to have a good time at school, and he asked for special arrangements
to be made for me so that I could stay out of the dormitory later than
the others, to be able to spend time with my class mates. It was a very
special occurrence when the headmaster gave the permission for this. To
me this felt as an enormous statement of trust, and I promised my
father that I would not breake any rules! To me, this became the first
time I learned what it meant for a child to have trust and
responsibility; the self-confidence grows. The matron at the dormitory
had a hard time accepting that I was allowed to bend the rules, and she
tried to argue with me, but I did not care about that. My father and
the headmaster had made the decision! I will never forget that
occurrence, which has shaped and coloured my pedagogical way of
thinking ever since.
</p>
<p> I attended a voluntary 10th year in secondary school. During that
year I learned German from Einar Gullichsen. He became the person who
inspired me the most to apply for the teachers college.
</p>
<h3>A rounded childhood home</h3>
In those days, a fierce debate took place in Karasjok, concerning the
language of education. It was a widespread opinion that the Sami
language would not survive, and some Sami-speaking parents began to
speak Norwegian to their children. At home we spoke Sami, but my
parents still did not want us to learn Sami at school. They firmly
believed that we had to learn Norwegian to be able to manage in the
greater society. My father also signed a petition against the Sami
committee's propositions. He was an active member of the Labour Party
whose propaganda and fundamental view was that in these new times,
development could only take place through the Norwegian language. This
must have been a huge dilemma for my parents. At home they followed
our Sami language-acquisition closely, and they always told us to speak
correct and distinct Sami. Many years passed before they began to
understand that Sami, as a language and a cultural heritage, was
important, not only in the private sphere, but also in general public,
the judicial system and within the school.

<p> My father was a Laestadian preacher, but he was also a socialist.
This meant that in our home you could joik (traditional Sami
chanting), sing a psalm or political tunes like The International. My
father was a talented joiker and, even though the laestadian movement
and the church had banned the joik (it was regarded a sin), he made
joiks to his children. Our mother used to dance and she taught us how
to dance with her on the kitchen floor. None of these activities were
regarded as normal activities in the homes at that time.
</p>
<p> Our childhood home was rounded, not only in terms of opinions, but
also in terms of who came to see us. We had a little farm, and in
addition to the livestock we had our own reindeer<a href=#[5]>[5]</a>
All sorts of people came by our home; rich and poor, settled and
nomadic Sami, relatives and strangers, local people and travelers, Sami
friends from Kautokeino, preachers, clergymen, politicians, tourists
and other travelers.
</p>
<p> Later, I have regarded my open childhood home as a great source of
wealth. Naturally, my parents view of human life affected their
Christianity to become more loving than judging, and maybe their human
receptiveness became further strengthened during the war (WW2) when
they were refugees in Sweden. Their receptiveness towards others did
not weaken their sense of belonging to Sápmi and they had a strong Sami
identity. They emphasised the fact that all human beings have the same
value, and I have kept those words in my heart. As an adult I am deeply
grateful for the view of human life my childhood home created, namely a
view that gave equal status to everyone and a view that has been of
great value both in terms of personal life and in my work. I know that
a human being is not necessarily completely black-and-white, and it is
possible to feel confident even though different aspects of life call
for different mindset.
</p>
<p> Many years went by, and my parents had grown used to the idea that
Sami should be heard within the schools as well. This became a huge
source of support for us (the children). My family had kept our Sami
surname, Balto, and they did not replace it with a Norwegian name, such
as the Norwegian name of our farm, Randberg (The Sami name was
Fárpenjárga). Many of the Sami inhabitants in Karasjok changed their
surname as a result of the Land Sales Act that took effect in 1902. </p>
<p> A new challenge concerning our exchange of views came with the
development of the Alta-Kautokeino-watercourse. The older generation
feared the Norwegian government, and was afraid of a new war and
conflicts similar to what they had already experienced. Some of us
participated in the demonstrations against the Alta-development. Our
parents tried to dissuade us from going: "- Do not go there to start a
war". As far as they were concerned, the thought of their children
being taken care of by the police, was awful. I had to disobey. My
conscience forced me to oppose - to care for the Sami future. Even
though my parents did not approve, they helped us prepare for the
demonstrations in the cold winter climate by providing us with warm
clothing such as traditional fur shoes, fur coats and skin trousers.
<p> These stories illustrate the different and difficult choices Sami
people have come across. On one hand they wanted to protect and carry
on their own heritage, both in terms of language and culture. On the
other hand they feared that this would lead to reluctance towards the
Sami people.
</p>
<h3>"How do you experience being a Sami?"</h3>
In my years of youth I wanted higher education, but at that time it
was not that easy. My parents could not afford to have all the children
in gymnasium, and scholarships and loans were not provided at that
level. The only possibility I had was applying for 4 years at the
teachers college. In 1966, at the age of 18, I started at the teachers
college in Tromsø. They did not teach Sami at all at that time. We did
however have an interesting teacher in Nils Jernsletten<a href=#[6]>[6]</a>
who taught us Norwegian. I remember he asked me to write an essay on
"how do you experience being a Sami?" My immediate thought was: It is
not hard to be a human being, hence it is not hard to be Sami. It is
all up to yourself. If you are nice to others, they will be nice to
you. A kind of "smile-to-the-world" philosophy. The feed-back from Nils
suggested that I needed to take this matter into deeper consideration.
Later I got to learn that neither my own nor other's life as a Sami was
as easy as I had predicted.

<p> During my time in Tromsø, I often longed for the life back home and
I missed the Sami language and joik, and also the nearness to my
grandmother. I used to joik my closest relatives and friends to me, so
that they would fill up my little room. That way I became happy. There
was not an established Sami society in Tromsø (there were for instance
no such thing as a Sami Association). Our main input of Sami was
through Sámi Radio where we could feel like home in Kathrine Johnsen's
office.
</p>
<p>Now I know that there were many Sami people in Tromsø, but only a
few admitted who they were. We were approximately 20 students in my
class, and I knew that 4 of us were Sami. When we had our
25-years-reunion in 1995, it turned out that half of our class were
Sami!

<h3>A teacher without textbooks</h3>
My first job as a teacher was in the school year 1970/71 at Skoganvarre
school in Porsanger. Sverre Hatle had etablished basic training in Sami
at this school.<a href=#[7]>[7]</a>
During my year at Skoganvarre he was on leave in order to write Sami
textbooks and curriculums. I had two colleagues, one who spoke Sami,
and one who spoke Norwegian. Most of the children spoke, and the rest
understood, Sami.
<p>	I taught the smallest children in 1st-3rd grade. There were no such thing as textbooks, so we had to use flannelboards<a href=#[8>[8]</a> 
and cuttings of letters. We had to make new words for our classes every
night.
I had never learned to write Sami, and I did not learn it until i took
a basic course in Sami in 1979-80. The course took place in Alta, but
the University of Tromsø was responsible for the course. Håkon
Henriksen and Odd Mathis Hætta taught in Norwegian, and by our opinion,
this was both inconvenient and unnatural. We tried to change this, but
we did not succeed. The argument was that our group contained students
who spoke Norwegian and hence the lessons should be in Norwegian! I
found great amusement in reading Sami, even though the orthography was
changed in those days - it had not yet been decided whether we should
learn the old or the new spelling, and there had not yet been written
any books after the change in orthography.

<p> At the beginning of the 80's, I worked a few years as a teacher in
the Sami secion at the college in Alta. The teachers who taught Sami
there were Veikko Holmberg, Odd Mathis Hætta, Liv Østmo and Máret Sárá.
Máret and I taught Sami-related topics such as culture, ethnicity,
politics concerning minorities, methodology and didactics. We were also
responsible for the student's experience in teaching and to maintain
contact with the schools in which they were placed. The Sami section
was a powerful means in terms of lifting the consciousness and
confidence among the Sami students and the position of the "Saminess"
to a higher level.
 
<h3>One of our own is finally writing about our inheritance.</h3>
I studied social education at the University of Oslo, and most of the
teachers hardly knew anything about Sami conditions. My 4 years of
studies in Oslo would have been rather boring if professor Anton Hoem
had not worked there. When I entered his office it was almost as if I
entered my own "Sami home". In my last year, Anton was granted a leave
of absence, and went to the USA. His replacement as a supervisor was a
man from the social set of the Coast Sami: Asle Høgmo. I am deeply
grateful that I, through their splendid support end supervising,
received such good results for my examination.

<p> Working on my main subject was hard, but at the same time it gave
me so much because I had the possibility to talk to and interview
people in Karasjok on the subject of raising children. They were so
grateful that they were given the opportunity to tell their stories and
share some of their knowledge. Some of them said: "Finally, one of our
own is interested in writing about and preserving our knowledge about
this". This taught me a lot about generosity and sharing: people want
to share their experience and knowledge of traditions in order to carry
on this knowledge to younger generations.

<h3>Where is the loyalty?</h3>


In 1989 the director of the Sami Education Council, Edel Hætta Eriksen, reached the retirement age<a href=#[9]>[9]</a>
I was encouraged to apply for that position, and after applying I was
called in for an interview. The interviewers referred to, among other
things, the rules at the time which demanded that people in higher
office had to sign a declaration of loyalty. I though it was a bit
funny when they asked me what I would do should I ever disagree with
the employer, the ministery, so that an conflict of interest could occur.
I answered them straight-forward that my aim was to build up a Sami
system of education, and if the ministry prevented me from doing so
I would resign! My loyalty was in the Sami community. No representative
from the ministry was present during the interview, and I don't know
if anyone from the ministry got to know what I answered. The
loyalty-demand for officials was withdrawn during that time and I never
had to sign any such declaration.

<p> There were major challenges working in the council and it was fun
to continue on the good foundation Edel had laid. The first was to make
the authorities understand how large the needs of the Sami
education-sector were. We put a lot of effort into finding out how we,
in the best way possible, could show how the pupil-, teacher- and
teaching-material situation really was. We made statistics and graphic
presentations every year which showed number of pupils, and how many who
had Sami as a first and second language.


<h3>Prioritise teaching of second language?</h3>
The information we gathered from the schools showed a large increase in
number of pupils who has Sami as a second language.
At the same time the schools, pupils and parents stated that the
results of the second language teaching was not satisfying. It wasn't enough
teaching-material and the teachers lacked academic and/or pedagogic
education. It was as a whole little knowledge, also among the educated
teachers, on how to teach second language in such a way that the pupils
would become active speakers of it. It became my top priority to work
to improve the language situation for those kids and young people who
had lost their mother tongue and wanted to take it back.
I saw that we did not have the knowledge we needed for second language
teaching in Norway. We had to look into what was happening elsewhere
which we could compare ourselves to. And when I was invited to an
international conference for minority languages in 1991, I realised
that we could have an advantage with contacts abroad. The conference
was about regional minority languages in Europe and was held in Wales.
<p> Later many Sami delegations have travelled to Wales and I was the
one who set it into motion when I established contact with them.
I discovered that among the European minorities there is a lot of
people teach minority language as a second language. In Wales they have
worked on it for a long time, and the results have been good.
They emphasise the communicative perspective, teaching grammar is not
the most important thing. In our teaching of Sami the formal way of
teaching language dominated for a long time. We visited Trinity
College, where teaching of second language is a separate subject in the
teacher education and one could also study this as a separate subject
all the way to the doctoral degree.
</p>

a study trip to Wales, and thereafter a lot of teachers and students

</table>


<p> When I came back I decided to take the initiative for a major
conference about second languge education/teaching and emphasise the
communicative aspect of teaching language. The main issue became the
revival of the Sami language. It was the first time second language
teaching received this kind of attention in Sápmi.
</p>
<p> The next step of the work with language was a course in second
language pedagogy, which the Sami Education Council arranged together
with the Sami University College in 1992/93. We invited teachers from
Wales to teach on this course and the students went there on a school
trip. This course was a trial project, no study points were awarded,
but it was very valuable for giving the schools new ideas and to build
a foundation for the Sami University College to two years later offer a
permanent study-programme in bilingual pedagogy and it also lead to
bilingualism becoming a subject in the teacher education.
</p>
<p> The experiences from Wales showed that the schools alone could not
revive the language, one has to look at the situation in society in
general. Important tools are language centres, language nests and also
the media. The guest lecturers mentioned all of this at the conference
in 1991, and we took the language centre concept from Wales and adapted
it to Sami conditions. We, among other things, emphasised that it
should not be purely a language centre, but both an language- and
culture centre. The education division was not the only ones who made
contacts in Wales. Other institutions visited as well, the Sami Radio
for example got to know Welsh media-institutions. </p>
<p>	I started a proccess writing a book about second language teaching  <i>Duostta hupmat / Våg å snakke</i> (Dare to talk),
where experiences from both Wales and Sapmi surfaced. It was the first time such a book was available to everyone. The Education Council also
made the film <i>Čoavdda guovtti máilbmái / En nøkkel til to verdener</i> (A key to two worlds), which was aimed especially at motivating parents to talk Sami with their children and choose Sami subjects at school.

<h3>Kvens are also minority language speakers</h3>
When we started to announce the new ideas about second language
teaching, we got a lot of critique for not taking the Kvens' situation
into consideration. One Kven teacher who participated in the conference
explained that these new teaching-methods were just as useful for them.
The Sami and Kven community had the same interests, which lead to the
Sami University College arranging courses in multi-lingual pedagogy,
some years in cooperation with the division of Finnish at the Finnmark
University College. Among the students were teachers of both Sami- and
Finnish and others who were interested in improving teaching of Sami
and/or Finnish.

<h3>Establishing a centre for teaching material</h3>
The second major challenge I worked on was to improve the teaching material situation. It was a known issue that there was a huge lack of
teaching material and that the schools were suffering as a result, but it was difficult to get the ministry to understand it. We conducted
a thorough investigation into how much, or rather how little, teaching material was available in Northern-, Lule- and Southern Sami for each
subject and class.

<p> The goal was to offer each subject and class a set of books: textbook, workbook and a teacher's guide. The survey showed how serious the situation was. A graphic presentation showed that we in most subjects failed to meet the minimum goal, and the situation was rather that many subjects did not have a single approved teaching material available. In the Norwegian school and the Norwegian language education there were not only rules but also room to chose between different sets of books, and in addition choose additional books, reference- and handbooks for each subject. That way of visualising the situation gave results. In the ministry they started to realise how much of a hinder the lack of teaching material was for the Sami schools and language aquisition.
</p>
<p> The allocations to the production of teaching material were so
small that with the present speed it would take at least 50 years
before all the subjects would meet the minimum target. But the lack of
money was not the only problem. We also needed authors of teaching
material, and it was usually teachers who could write textbooks. When
it was a significant lack of teachers at the same time, it was natural
for the schools to feel that the work with teaching material stole
teachers from them. The teachers had a large workload and making
teaching material required additional knowledge. We arranged a course
in producing teaching material, where we received help from the
national centre of teaching material and from Sami publishers.
</p>
<p> In 1991 we managed to squeeze a small sum of money out of the
ministry to investigate the teaching material situation and
establish centres for teaching material. The idea was that if we
wanted to highlight on the teaching material situation, we needed our
own centre for teaching material. It was not supposed to be a part of
the normal work of the education council. It should be our own
employees who worked on just that, and it should also be a showroom
were everyone could see the teaching material that existed. The
ministry appointed a commitee that I was in charge of. In the
commitee with me was my colleague Kristine Nystad and people from both
county and ministry. Vi surveyed the teaching material situation in
Sápmi and compared it with equivalent areas when it came to the size of
the language. We surveyed the Faeroe Islands and Greenland and found out
that there were good examples which we could take advantage of. Among
other things were own teaching material centres.

<h3>Relocation of the education council to the Sami Parliament</h3>
From its inception in 1976 the Sami Education Council had been a
consultative body for the Ministry of Education. And although much
had been changed in the Sami policy in the period, the organisation of
the Sami education sector had not.

<p>In 1991, an inter-ministrial work group evaluated the transfer of
functions and powers to the Sami Parliament. The group said about the
Sami education council: <i>
The work group assumes that it might be natural at the moment to wait
for a while with the transfer of authority from the central authorities
to the Sami Parliament in terms of the Sami Education Council's
operations. However, one should as a start immediately be able to
transfer the authority to appoint the Sami Education Council to the
Sami Parliament. </i>

</p>
<p> In 1993 the Sami Parliament appointed a commitee that studied how
the Sami education sector could be organised. I was in charge of this
commitee, and with me was Randi Nordback Madsen from the Ministry of
Education, Mikkel Nils Sara from the Sami University College, Jon Meloy
from the Sami Secondary School and Reindeer Herding School and Ella Holm
Bull for the Sami Parliament. Our report was called<i> "Utredning av
omorganisering av den samiske utdanningssektoren. Innstilling fra et
utvalg oppnevnt av Sametinget".</i> ("Report of reorganisation of the Sami
education sector. Recommendations from a commitee appointed by the Sami
Parliament".) The report was only published in Norwegian. The
commitee lined up 6 possible ways of organising and advocated for the
one that gave the most power to the Sami Parliament. Among other things
we suggested that the Sami Parliament should have the mandate to decide
the content of the Sami school so that they themselves could decide the
curricula.
</p>
<p> Some parts of our proposals were implemented, but the Sami
Parliament did not get as much power as we had expected. We proposed to
place the Sami Education Council under the Sami Parliament. This
happened, but when the Sami Parliament got power over the organisation
of the Sami education administration they decided to close down the
entire Sami Education Council. The education council disappeared in the
Sami Parliament's process of changing the organisation, and so the
politically elected academic community that had been highly visible in
the Sami community disappeared as well. All that was left was one
administration: The Sami Parliament's education division. Above this
was only the Sami Parliamentary Council, with members without any
special expertise or interest in school related issues. In the council
there were 5 politically elected representatives who were supposed to
govern all aspects of the Sami policy.

<h3>Difficult birth for Sami curricula</h3>
When I started working in the Sami education council we had the
standard curriculum M87, which had some Sami curricula. We did not do
curriculum work then, the main issue was rather to make strategies for
work with Sami teaching material. But we did not get to work in peace
for long as the Minister of Education, Gudmund Hernes, started working
on reforms. First came the common general curricula for primary, upper
secondary and adult education. Start-up conferences was arranged in
each county, and I represented the Sami interests at the conference
in Vadsø in 1991. There I made our needs clear and also Norway's
commitment to treat the Sami perspective seriously when working with
the curricula. But what came in the general part was very poor. It was
in no way acceptable to us. Then came the Reform 94 for secondary
education, but the Sami education council had little capasity to work
with this, so we sent a policy statement. We had to prioritise the
primary school. And we only had one consultant working with cases
concerning secondary school teaching. In our council there were
mostly primary school people as well.

<p> I quit the education council at the end of 1993, but continued a
little with curricula work in 1994, as the ministry had appointed me
for a reference-group working with curricula. The ministry's idea
was that it should be only one curricula for everyone, and that some
Sami subjects fitted into the national curricula. The Ministry of Church-,
education-, and research wrote in a letter of 14.01.1994
that the ministry had promoted: The idea that the new standard curriculum
should be a national curriculum which includes all teaching given to the
country's primary school pupils, also those in the Sami core areas. The
argument for Sami subjects was that it is important for all students in
the Norwegian school to obtain a better and broader understanding of
the Sami population's culture and history. That means that the
ministry used the Norwegian students' need for learning about the
Sami as an argument against a separate Sami curricula! We could
obviously not accept this. We had recently got a Sami curricula in some
subjects, so we could in no way accept that the Sami content in Sami
schools should be weakened when the Sami legal position was stronger
than ever. The Sami education council answered on 04.02.1994:<i> "The Sami
education council disagrees in that there should be a common national
curriculum. A separate curriculum has to be made for the areas that are covered by
the language rules of the Sami law. It has to, in addition to containing curricula on every subject,
contain a general part". </i>
Three days later there was a meeting with the reference-group for the
work with the curricula. It is obvious from the meeting report that I
disagreed with the ministry: <i>"Asta Balto made a reservation according the refered comments under the headline Sami language,
culture and Sami pupils, second last bullet point. There is a need for
individual Sami plans. She distributed a new note with clarifications
of her earlier input to the reference-group". </i>

</p>
<p> In the note I explained more thoroughly the Sami school situation,
our collective rights and why there was a need for both individual Sami
curricula and subjects in the national curricula. After the meeting I
sent a letter to the leader of the group, where I explained what I
meant with individual Sami curricula like this: The first paragraph
signals that the Sami content for Sami students is local information.
The possibility for local adaption is okay, but it must not be replaced
with, or be at the expense of, the possibility for a joint Sami design
for the schools. I would like to remind you that the Sami people has
collective rights to develop a school with basis in the Sami community,
šhich must be regarded as something different from simply local emphases and specialisation in Sami
language and culture. It rather conserns curricula based on the Sami
language and culture. It involves a joint Sami knowledge-, culture-,
and value base from Elgå in the south to Kirkenes in the north, and not
least a commuity that also reaches beyond the borders, to Sweden,
Finland and Russia.
</p>
<p>	The ministry did not seem to understand this yet, because on 24.02.1994 director Hanna Marit Jahr wrote: <i>"I
also refer to the meeting with SUR (Sami Educational Council) in Oslo
30.11.1993, were it was said from all quarters that Sami pupils should
be ensured the same knowledge fundation as any other pupil in the
primary school. It is also in line with the ILO-convention's chapter 2,
that members of these peoples enjoy the rights and opportunities that
national laws and regulation secures for other members of the
population, in line with these". </i> This is secured through the
joint mandatory teaching material for all pupils. It also secures the
Sami pupils equal qualifications after completed primary school.
</p>
<p> They still had the old-fashioned notion that equal status was the
same thing as learning exactly the same, that is to say that everyone should be treated
in the same way; as Norwegians. The Sami commitee had explained this important difference as early as in 1959, and this difference had a clear political significance for Sami people and other indigenous peoples. To
include Sami content into the reform was heavy and hard work and one can
not boast about minister Hernes' interest for Sami issues. We had to
hurry to mobilise the leading politicians in the Sami Parliament in
order to save the Sami part of the reform. At the end of the process
Hanna Marit Jahr had started to give in to the Sami demands about an
individual Sami curricula, and Sami subjects in the national curriculum was
the result. As long as I worked in the Sami Education Council we did
not have any direct link to Hernes and he never asked us for advice,
not a single time. He never visited the education council nor Sami
areas in my time, even though we invited him multiple times.
</p>
<h3>Southern and Lule-Sami threatened</h3>
In my role as director I got to know various Sami affairs, and I became
worried when I saw how threatened the Southern-Sami and Lule-Sami
languages were. There were barely children who spoke Sami as their first
language and researchers claim that it is a sign of language death. If
the children does not learn the languages, who will then transfer them to
future generations? They had poorer teacher- and learning material
situation than in Northern Sami areas.

<p> Lule Sami representative in the Sami Education Council was Anne Kalstad Mikkelsen, who also was one of the parents who started Lule-Sami kindergarden in Tysfjord. They managed to get the children to talk Sami to such a degree that when they started in primary school they had Lule-Sami as their first language. It was such a large success that it was striking and the parent group later received the Sami Parliament's language awards. It was heart-warming
when they thanked me for my support in the acceptance speech.
</p>
<p> The Southern-Sami representative in the education council was
Sig-Britt (Pia) Persson. She was eager to start a Southern-Sami
kindergarden in Snåsa. The idea was to set up a language nest, where
there would be room for 12 Southern-Sami children. We had great
expectations and were delighted that we had managed to recruit two
Southern-Sami teacher-students from Sweden and that enough children had
been signed up. When we were supposed to start the in the autumn,
several parents pulled out, without us knowing why, and with only two
children left we could not start the project. We had to abandon the
plan, and because of this the Southern-Sami language did not receive the
help it sorely needed, and which could have contributed to preserve and
develop the language and form a foundation for today's language work in
this area. Many years of struggle and trial was in vain.
</p>
<p> Now (2006) I am working a bit with language in the southern Sami
areas. I am in the steering group for the language motivation project
the Sami Parliament started in 2001. The aim with this is to revitalise
the language of the kindergarten generation, the language their
grandparents speak, but the parents don't know.

<h3>Sami University College – design of higher education </h3>
When I began as a teacher at the Sami University College in January 1994
the first thing I got to teach was multicultural pedagogy, or as it was
later named; Multicultural understanding. I had made the course-plan
myself together with Vigdis Stordahl and Liv Østmo.
<p> In those days one had begun to develop so-called migration-pedagogy
in Oslo and Bergen, among other places. When we compared those courses
with out own we found a major difference: Their courses were made on
the terms of the majority-society, they viewed multiculturalism as a
problem, not as a treasure. Our basis was that our cultural knowledge
is a treasure, but we have to use it to move on. We should not only mind our own business.</p>
<p> A lot of Sami people think that our cultural knowledge is so strong
that we don't need to write about it. My though has rather been that we
need the theory as a foundation for understanding our own culture in
the encounter with other cultures.
</p>
<p> Multicultural pedagogy back then was the only course on offer at
the Sami Community College that was taught in Norwegian, because we
wanted this course to be a course were cultures met. Sami-speaking Sami
people, Norwegian-speaking Sami people and non-Sami people should all
be able to participate. The students were not only teachers, they also
came from other professions, for example journalists, social- and
health workers, psychologists and culture workers.
</p>
<p> It was a very popular subject, and in addition to the courses that
have been in Kautokeino, we have arranged lessons i Snåsa, Tysfjord and
Vadsø. Cultural understanding has become part of the general courses,
just like the journalism- and teacher course. We have also held a
number of short courses. The need is much larger than what we have
capasity for.
</p>
<p> I have learned that this course has really changed the students'
minds. I remember a student who said: "If I had learned this when I
was 20 years old, my life would have been completely different."
</p>
<p> My main idea with this course has been to build peace
and bridges between different people and peoples, and that knowledge,
understanding and communication are useful tools for achieving that.
</p>
<h3>Collaboration between higher education for indigenous people.</h3>
In my time working at the Sami University College I have been allowed
to take part in a lot of interesting work. International cooperation is
one of the most important areas. I don't think that the University
College would have come so far as it has today if we had not nurtured
the contact with other indigenous people. This contact has strenghtened
and motivated us in the work to promote higher education and research
in Sami. Sami and other indigenous people have exchanged experiences
and knowledge about the effects of colonisation etc.

<p>We have a lot of times thought that what others can do elsewhere, we
should be able to do as well. I can mention one excample from Canada,
where the Dene-people have managed to create their own curricula, "Dene
Curriculum". This is a real indigenous people plan, built on their own
traditions and way of thinking. Unlike Norway, where the Sami curriculum
of 1997 is nothing else than the Norwegian curriculum adapted to the Sami
people. It has also been a huge inspiration to see how other indigenous
peoples use the knowledge of others in school and production of
teaching material. Some institutions have individual courses where they
learn methods to gather and make use of indigenous peoples knowledge in
education and research.

<p>	And I also hope that the experiences of the Sami University College can be useful for other indigenous peoples.
