      <td><b>Marit and Bill (William) Aubert were teachers at Sirma
school in the period 1950-53. During this time they were the only
teachers at this school. They were both born in 1927, Marit Aubert, born
Strømme, in Lyngør in Aust-Agder, and William Dorenfeldt Aubert in Oslo.
They both attended the teachers college in Oslo, where Marit completed the
education for home economics before they both headed north in 1950. </b>
      <p><b>After the time in Sirma they moved to Drammen. They both
did further education, and attained sixth form teacher competence with time.
She worked in the elementary school and he worked in the gymnasium.
William Aubert died in 1985, but Marit Aubert is still living in
Drammen. After retiring she has been very interested in
school history, and has been involved in the work with The Norwegian School History Collections in Drammen. </b> </p>
      <p><b>
While being in Sirma both of them frequently wrote to their
family down south, and a great number of these letters have been
preserved.
They also shot a great amount of photographs, both from the school and
elsewhere in the village. They were probably the only ones who had a
photo camera in Sirma at the time, these photographs are thus quite
unique. In 1996, at the request of old pupils, Marit Aubert wrote down
memories from the 1950s. Theese were collected into a binder by previous
principal Toralv Pedersen. We have been given the permission to </b><span style="font-weight: bold;">recite</span><b>

<h3>The road to Sirma</h3>

What made two southerners come to Sirma? To give a brief answer, it has
to be in only one word, namely coincidences. Bill was serving in the
Royal Guards the autumn 1949. To be close by I applied for a post in
Stabekk, where I met a teacher who had been teaching at the boarding
school in Polmak for 7 years. It was Kari Knudsen, or Storkari (Big
Kari), as she was called. After a while she figured out that Bill and I
should apply for Sirma. The first time we heard the word Sirma, we
did not even know where it was. We were curious, and Kari had to tell us
more about it. She recounted about the river as means of transport, the
mountains surrounding Sirma as a great terrain for hiking, shortage of
teachers and pleasant children.
<p> Early in 1950 Bill called the chairman of the school board to
enquire about the opportunities for posts for two teachers at the
boarding school in Sirma. It was District Sheriff Jann Olsen who was
the chairman this period. The opportunities for employment were very
good, and in spring Polmak advertised. In Sirma there was a "furnished
apartment with connected water". In as much as we did not own
one single piece of furniture, the furnished apartment was very
tempting to us. It did not state anything about the quality of the
furniture, nor that the connected water could freeze in October not to
return until July. </p>

<p> Both of us applied for the positions, and sent both certificates
and references. When the summer holiday started to draw close, and we
still had not heard anything, Bill called north. He was actually a bit
worried that we might not get the positions. District Sheriff Olsen let
out a real guffaw. Of course we were hired! We were the only qualified teachers
who had applied at all. We would receive a written confirmation. Up
until then Sirma had never had permanent employed teachers with
education. </p>

<p> We left Drammen 30th of July 1950. Teachers who went to Finmark in
those days were entitled to compensation for moving. Bill and I did not
represent an expense in that sense. We owned a fishing rod, a camera
and a small radio. Bill belonged to the upper class and had two duvet
covers and two sheets. I had one duvet cover myself, life in the
bedsit had put an end to the rest. In addition we had some clothes.
Nothing to write home about. Textiles were still on ration cards. We
had heaps of clothing ration cards, but they were not of much use, as
the shops rarely had exactly the goods we needed. We carried
the entire moving load in two backpacks and our own hands. </p>

<p> We travelled by train over Oslo to Stockholm. We stopped there for
two days before continuing by train to Narvik. From there we
went to Tromsø by bus, and from Tromsø we travelled with
Hurtigruten to Vadsø. The journey took us five days, and it was an
adventure from the beginning until the end. Saturday 5th&nbsp; of August we got
off the bus in Skipagurra and walked down towards the riverbank. We met
two salmon anglers there. They told us that the post boat for Sirma had
left north the day before. They did not know when the next would leave.
Our wealth at the time were two crumpled 10 banknotes. What on earth
were we to do? We sat there for a long time, both of us were both tired
and hungry, and found it more wisely to shut up. Eventually
a boat came up the river. It drove close to where we sat. All of a
sudden Bill cried: "Are you going to Polmak?" "Yes", was the reply.
"Will you bring us for 20 kroner and let us off at the
boarding school?". They agreed, and we got on board. ... This is how Bill
described the trip in a letter home: "It was a monster of a boat
measuring 1 x 10 m. We were seven people on board plus a dog, two bikes and
luggage. But when the motor started it moved. Faster than Hurtigruta, in
a cloud of water spray, we headed upwards to Polmak. I am
convinced that to travel by riverboat up Tana must be one of the
wonders of the world".
</p>

<p>We walked to the boarding school where we were welcomed by teacher
Hjelmbrekke. Soon we were seated at the table and thereafter we fell
asleep on two matresses in a classroom. After breakfast the following
day Hjelmbrekke drove us to Båteng. He called Isak Hansen who came with
his truck. We borrowed money to pay for the lift and the riverboat from
Bildan, and soon we stood outside Inga's house. Yes, we would get a
lift. Her husband was not at home, so she would take us herself. </p>

<p> The river was low this summer, so Bill and Inga had to wade out in
the river to loosen the boat. Before we left, Inga had called Sirma and
told that the two new teachers were on their way. As a result we were
met by a whole lot of people on the riverbank. </p>

<p> The trip up was lovely, and I was filled with impressions as we
stepped ashore. I shook many hands, but the only one I remember
concretely is Nils Varsi. He came with a chest containing the contents
of the cash box and the keys. They helped us find our way, and soon we
stood outside the barracks where we were to live. ....
</p>

<h3>Barracks with draught</h3>The barracks was probably built in a
hurry. If we laid down on the
floor, we could look outside. The first winter a lot of ice were formed
on the floor inside the barracks. For that reason I had a couple of involuntary
slides. In one of the rooms, in the "living room department" we had
a nice desk, a chair and a bookshelf. It became "the office". In the
other room there were two armchairs with string covers. Anna, the house
keeper in the boarding school, told us that they had been sent from <strong>lotter
</strong><a href=#[1]>[1]</a> in Moss just after the war. There was a rectangular coffee table
and bedboards which someone had hammered four legs on. There was not more, but we were delighted. ...
<p> Compared to today's standards the residence was beyond all
criticism. However, we felt comfortable in the barracks. Looking back I sense
the feeling of freedom I had. It was not necessary to lock the door. We
did not have any insurances. The objects did not own us as they do today.
Still - we did not miss anything. ...<br>

<h3>Frightened first-graders </h3>

It was very exciting when the pupils came the 24th of August and were
installed in the school. Both from the north and from the south they
were transported in riverboats. Everyone had brought luggage, some
carried small wooden chests, other had their things in paper-bags, it
was before the era of the plastic bags. The 2. and 3. graders ran
boldly into the school building. They knew where they were going. The
boys to the big hall on the second floor, the same entrance as the
classroom. The girls had the main entrance, straight ahead one went in
to a dining room and a living room, and walking up the stairs one
walked in to two bedrooms.
<p> The new first-graders looked very frightened. The ones who had
siblings to hold on to, clung to them. A few did not know anybody, and
it was good to have Anna there who spoke Sami. All the beds were ready
and had clean bed linen. When each and all had found a bed, they came
down to eat. Afterwards they all went out to play or visit relatives in
Sirma. After the evening meal the first day, the children had to start
to get ready for the night. Lukewarm water had been poured into the
water mugs and the pupils had been brought a glass or a cup for the
toothbrush. Not all of the children had a toothbrush for their first
encounter with the school, but Anna had a toothbrushes in stock and
handed them out. The small ones were tired after the arrival, and fell
asleep fast. Bill and I waited a while to go upstairs to wish the
children goodnight. On my first goodnight-round I got to see that the
ones who where far away from home for the first time, had crawled up into
the beds of the older children. Bill experienced the same thing. If
they had fallen asleep we would lift them carefully back into their own
beds. If not, we would let them stay, and Anna would move them back in
their beds when she did her round before going to bed. It was important
to make them used to fall asleep separately, after time they would
discover that it was not dangerous after all.&nbsp; </p><table bgcolor="#ffcf77" border="2" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td>

<h3>Life in the boarding school<br>
</h3>The rhythm of the day in the boarding school was the same both for
the small children (1rst, 2nd and
3rd grade) and for the older ones (4th, 5th, 6th, 7th grade). The
pupils were woken up by the house maids around 7 in the morning. (Anna
had two maids every year, and when we were in Sirma, these two came
from Nesseby.) During the polar night most of them wanted to sleep
longer, but there was never much silence for that. We always had some
early morning birds who would make sure everyone got out of their beds.
During the winter-months the dressing would take more time than in the
rest of the year. All the fur-shoes had to be filled with grass, and
it had to be done according to the regulations. Not all of the children
were good at this, and the younger ones had to seek help from the older
children. The breakfast table was set at 8 o'clock. The small
dining hall was completely filled when everybody was in their place. The
table was set for Anna and the teachers in the kitchen. The door
between the two rooms was kept open, so we were able to see what was
going on.&nbsp; <br>
<br>

<p>We rarely had to say anything. The food tasted good, and the pupils
ate nicely. Before each meal everyone stood up and sang the blessing.
The housekeepers had always made ready sandwiches on the plates. After
the meal we had about 10 minutes left before the school were to start. <br>
</p>

<p>At this point some pupils ran to the bedroom to make the bed, some tidied, others went
out to play and others again payed a visit to the outside
lavatory. I remember one of our students who refused completely to go
to the toilet. He simply sat down in the schoolyard. Anna had to explain to
him that when we were so many people in one place, we needed to follow
different rules than the ones he followed when he was in the mountains.
The boy looked at Anna, thereafter proclaimed that he did not want to
go to the toilet. "But why not?" Anna asked. "No, it smells so bad in
there", the little guy replied. Anna was amused when telling us this story. <br>
</p>

<p>The teaching started at 08.30. As in the regular Norwegian school we
had three lessons with 10 minutes breaks in between. The lunch break
was
at 11 o'clock. Normally breakfast and lunch consisted of bread, spread
and milk, but now and then hot chocolate was served. After the meals
there was a slice of Swedish turnip or a piece of carrot. At 11.30
three more lessons started. Dinner was served at 14.30. After dinner
the pupils had some chores in turns. Some had to get milk, others had
to go to Tapio to get goods, some cleaned off the dinner table, others
dried off the cups and put the service away. These small chores were
popular, and one would always get something once the job was done. And
when the rain and cold started, it was always comfortable to be
able to spend some more time in the kitchen area.<br>
</p>

<p>Otherwise the time before doing homework was spent differently.
Some of the pupils went to their relatives in Sirma, others played
outdoors, meanwhile others again played in the classroom. Everyone were
gathered at 16 o'clock. The pupils who lived in Sirma had gone home by
that time, so we would manage with one classroom for doing homework.
When our daughter Anne Marie was born
26th of December 1950, Bill took on this part of the job on a regular basis. The
intention of being present was two-sided:&nbsp; <br>
1. To ensure peace and quiet for working, and <br>
2. To offer help<br>
</p>

<p>As the children felt their homework were done, they went outside.
However it was remarkable how many who continued working up until the
supper at 18.00. It was not all imposed work, but they read more and drew.
Supper changed between sandwiches and porridge twice a week. ...</p>
<p>Bill and I started to read for the pupils in the evening to make
them calm down. We got hold of a lot of children's books from the south,
many of wich were classics we knew from our own childhood, but we also
bought newer literature and tried to make a school library. The pupils
who did not understand what we read, fell asleep rather quickly, while
others listened intensively. In the end most of their eyes were closed, we
could say goodnight and tip-toe out.&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>The children's dormitories probably would not have been approved
today, neither in terms of sanitary nor security reasons. At
the time we did not think about square metres pro pupil or
allergenic substances, but security was a matter that occupied us a
lot. We had to keep fire in the oven for many months a year. The
firewood was piled in the dormitories. The pupils had to put the grass
for their fur-shoes close to the oven to make it dry for the next
day. How easily it could have caught fire! It was strictly forbidden to play
with the fire, but we never dared to trust our pupils to obey this
rule. When 12 little boys are playing at their highest intensity before
bedtime nobody knows what could happen. ...&nbsp; <br>
</p>

<p>The maids' regular task was to put firewood in the ovens. The
dormitory heated quickly, but the barracks was a different matter. Up
there the ink pots froze every night in some periods, and we had to
make them defrost on the oven. When the cold was at it's worst, the
pupils had to wear mittens in class. Every now and then we had
to get up to flail our arms, only in the late morning it actually
became comfortable to stay in the classroom. The first winter was the
worst. In the summer of 1951 the classroom in the barracks was
renovated and isolated. We chose a bright yellow colour for the walls and we got
curtains, and I found that the room became pleasant with time. 

<h3>On an empty stomach....</h3>
 Being a house keeper in a boarding school was
not an easy job. It was her responsibility that we would have enough
food in the house at any given time, that the bed linen were cleaned
and to oversee that each and all of the rooms were kept clean. She also
took care of all the maintenance of the bed linen, towels and clothes
for the pupils. Even in the 1950s the circumstances were difficult for
many families along the Tana river, and yard goods and clothes were
difficult to get hold of. Anna bought flannel from Finland, and from
these rolls she sewed shirts and pants for the pupils. When we took a bath
on Fridays, the pupils who needed it were allowed to use these clothes.
The little ones called the garments "state-pants" and "state-shirts".
It was good for them to change into clean clothes after a whole week.
...&nbsp;<br>
 </p>

<p>Anna bought the winter-supplies of food in big quantas. The daily food supplies were bought in Taipo, which got a rich selection of goods with time. Flour, sugar, grain, etc were bought in sacks from a wholesale dealer in Vadsø, potatoes and vegetables came from Tromsø,
she ordered codfish and halibut from Varangerbotn, salmon, sheep and reindeer meat were bought in Sirma. She bought cordial and jam in
5-litre buckets, and cloudberries were picked on the marshes beyond Sirma. <br>

<h2>Extracts from letters home <br>
</h2>&nbsp;<b>Letters from Bill:</b>
<p><i>Sirma, 9th of August 1950.<br>Dear father and mother. <br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Well, here we are, finally. It is warm and beautiful outside, but
it is pleasant to relax a little bit inside. We arrived here monday 7th
of August at about 11 o'clock in the morning, so now I am starting to
get an overview of what needs to be done. Some painting in- and outside
would not be a bad idea. The bucket and the brush are ready, so I suppose
we will get things going soon. <br>

</i></p>

<p><i>The school in itself is a big building, almost timbered and
panelled on the outside, with the dormitories and one bedroom for the
staff situated on the second floor. In the attic there is also a room
furnished for one person. Downstairs there is a kitchen, dining room,
living room and the classroom. The basement of 4x4 m look good. We have
most of one of the long sides of the barracks. ... <br>
 </i></p>

<p><i>We use one separated room as bedroom. It seems quite new,
panelled. I am going to oil the floor there today. Then there are two
connected rooms without a door in between, about 4x3 and 3x3. The ovens
looks good, and there is a foundation wall under the house. The
household contents are also acceptable. The barrack is 15 m long and
7,8 m wide. Across the hallway we have a bedroom, two rooms for washing
and sauna, and in the end of the hallway there is the classroom that Marit will
have.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

</i></p>

<p><i>We hope to get started the 28th of August, but time will show. As
I assumed, we will have about 50 children in total, of which about 40
will be living in the dormitories. From autumn on the lower primary
school, first and second division will come for 7 weeks, then Marit
will have the newcomers and I the 2. and 3. grade. Afterwards the upper
primary school will come and stay their 20 weeks, and after easter the
lower primary school will return the second time. A quite odd
arrangement, but reportedly so to allow the older children to help
out at home in the summertime. It seems that we will have some teaching
aids, I talked with the Chief Education Officer today. Among other things we
should get nice new woodwork equipment, so in spring we can get
started teaching woodwork.&nbsp; ...<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Friday evening Anna, who is a great woman, arrived. She also
brought one of the maids, so now Marit and I have very nice days. The
barrack has got a coat of red paint, and the rooms start to be
organized. One of the days we went strolling in the mountains, it was
magnificent colours, but rather cold. It could be that the fair weather
we have had a lot of is about to finish. ...&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>
</p>

<p>The next letter is dated 25th of August. <br>

</p>

<p><i>Thank you for your letter. It is nice to get post, but none of us
feel the solitude the least heavy. Today we slowly began school. But,
the pupils arrive slowly but surely, and we will not have everybody here
before Wednesday. Marit's class is by now counting 6 pupils, and my 2. and 3.
grade are 17. The children seem pleasant, but we do not understand much
of one another. Otherwise everything is ready for them by now. 18
of them will live in the dormitory this round. ---&nbsp;</i>
</p>

<p>17th of September: </p>

<p><i>So, we have been running the school for 14 days already. The
children are more or less as in the south, we think, and the ones we
have now are nice and pleasant. But - there is no doubt that the
children should have learned Sami in the school, at least for the first
three years. <br>
 </i></p>

<p><i>It is rather sad when you think about that only one of ten pupils
find any pleasure in listening to the fairytales we read for them. It is just as difficult with
religion as with fairytales. Most of the time we
work with Norwegian and Math, but 5 hours a day is a lot for the little
ones, they get disheartened by the end of the day, restless too. Most
of them are normal when it comes to intelligence, but we also have
several who are very gifted, moreover a couple of weak ones, who need
more help than the others.</i>
</p>


<p>6th of October: </p>

<p><i>In school we are progressing rather slowly, but at least
there is progress. Poor children who do not have teachers who speak
their own language. It is a crime against them. As much as Marit and I
would like to, we are not able to offer our students proper
teaching.&nbsp;</i>
</p>

<p>25th of October: </p>

<p><i>We have now entered the last week with the little ones. Sadly
they have not learned much. The language is the barrier. We did not
learn much Sami ourselves either, we somehow fall between two stools
when we have to teach the children Norwegian. Next year a Sami ABC will
be published, it will be exciting, maybe we can learn also together with
the students. Yesterday "Big Pedar" brought me fur-shoes. It was
difficult to get hold of this good in size 46, but luckily Pedar has just as
big feet as me, so I got to buy a first-rate pair of fur-shoes which
originally was sown for him. They look marvellous with read and yellow
bonds and tassels, but the footprints I leave most of all resembles
bear-paws.</i>
</p>

<p>5th of November:</p>

<p> <i>The cold has arrived now, 19 degrees below zero today. We are
still doing very well. Friday I acted as a priest. Yes, really, since I
baptised a small boy after all the rules of the psalm book. Pavel Varsi
had his 7th boy, and as just was, he was named Håkon. ....</i>
</p>

<h3>More on Sami language<br>
</h3>I have quoted some letteres which expresses our frustration of not
being able to offer adequate teaching due to language problems. <br>The
cause for the following article written by Bill was a clip from one of
the newspapers in the capital that his mother sent us. I do not
have the clip, but I gather from Bill's contribution that someone had
written something about Sami teaching in the lower secondary school in
Karasjok. He - the writer&nbsp; - has&nbsp; apparently written that
Sami language will perish, and that the school is moving in the right
direction with it's norwegianization. <br>Today
the view on these things is completely different compared to what it
was in the 1950's. I find that Bill shows he was ahead of his time in
regard of the Sami-politics.<br>

<p><b>Extracts from Bill's letters from Finnmark 6th of September 1952.</b></p>

<p><i>"I for my part do not agree with the contribution in the
newspaper. The Sami Finmark has still not departed this life, although
"the culture" is not in high regard in these times. Forasmuch as
several thousand (also along the coast, in Nesseby for instance) use
Sami as their daily language, I can not understand that offering a little
bit of Sami teaching in the lower secondary school in Karasjok could
make any damage. It is fairly sure that Sami will be spoken for at
least 100 more years — why not learn the language better than they do at
home? Sami is not actually a primitive language. One can express
anything one would wish to in this language, thus I do not think it
will be extinct so appallingly soon. <br>
</i></p>

<p><i> Of course the lower secondary school in Karasjok means that
there will be a divide between Norwegians and Sami. That it should
bring about a down-valuing of the Sami people I can not understand as
anything but turning the matters upside down. It seems
obvious to me that a people who is not managing anything with its' own
language or craft, etc, will be down valued to a greater extent.
Forasmuch as reindeer husbandry will continue in Finnmark, the crafts
connected to it will continue to be in use as well.&nbsp;<br>

</i></p>

<p><i> Many of the clothes and tools which have been used and developed
through centuries, will obviously continue to be the best.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

</i></p>

<p><i> The article also mentioned that in the primary school<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
one is heading in the right direction — where Norwegians and Sami are
mixed, and only their capabilities influence their stand. From what I
gather this also needs to be completely wrong. In a class where
Norwegian is the language of teaching, maybe even with a teacher who
does not know Sami, it is evident that even poorly gifted Norwegian
speaking children have a great head start compared to the Sami
speaking. In
my opinion this situation should be splendidly suited to daunt the Sami children,
at least for the first three years, and they will most probably
determine a
lot for the years ahead as well. A rule that is a foundation stone in
anything that has to do with teaching: one shall move from the known to
the unknown, etc -is completely ignored when it comes to the Sami children. They
should start with the most difficult: a foreign language. A specific
curriculum for the bilingual districts is non-existent, and is of
course a very complicated story. A beginning have been made through the
ABC
and the Sami course of study in the teachers college in Tromsø, and
eventually more steps need to be made in the same direction.&nbsp; <br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Everyone up here wish to achieve a Norwegian standard of
living. This is not possible until roads are built here, etc, and
until they have equal opportunities for education like others. I
believe it would have a greater impact for the norwegianness up here
with steps in this direction, in stead of forcing a norwegianization
through the school, while the Sami are still a social underclass. The
school time needs to be extended for the Sami children, at least with a
couple of years, and in that time they need to learn to express
themselves both in Sami and Norwegian. I believe it is impossible for
one who is not able to express his thoughts in his own language to
learn a foreign language which is not used on a daily basis. <br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Well - this nearly turned into a treatise, but I have been
thinking quite a lot about these matters, so when you ask my opinion you need to take it in its entire length."</i>
