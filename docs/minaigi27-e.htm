<h2>Do you know Sami school history?</h2>

<b><i>Sámi skuvlahistorjá / Samisk skolehistorie</i> (Sami School History) is a series of books published by the publishing house Davvi Girji. In about 200 articles in 5 volumes there is told about the experiences of Sami children in Norwegian schools, and about the changes in the educational politics of the Norwegian authorities towards the Sami population. The books are published with parallell text in Sami and Norwegian language. <p> 

In this web site <a href="http://skuvla.info/skolehist/ssh1-e.htm">some of the articles of the first book</a> are also published in English. It would be too much to translate it all, so to make this history available to a greater public, we are translating a series of newspaper articles, which sorted by topics make a summary of stories in the books. So far there are 28 articles published in Sami language by the Sami newspapers <i>Min Áigi</i> and <i>Ávvir</i>. They are also published here in Norwegian and the English version will be published gradually as they are translated. 
<p>
These articles are edited by the main editor, Svein Lund. Besides him the editing board of the book series consist of Elfrid Boine, Siri Broch Johansen and Siv Rasmussen.</b>

<h1>Curriculums - for Norwegianization and for Sami school  </h1>
<h4>English translation by Ane Helga Lykka</h4>
Everyone that has attended primary school in Norway has been taught by a
 national curriculum, although one as pupil rarely sees the curriculum 
directly. The school researcher  Erling Lars Dale states it like this: <i>«Formal curriculums legitimates, describes and standardizes what school and education are about».</i>
<p> 
When the national curriculum of 1939 does not mention the Sami by one 
word, but in the section of the history subject states that «Our 
forefathers was part of the Germanic lineage», it is legetimating and 
standardizing that the Sami and Kven population should be ignored in the
 teaching, that they are to be seen as non-excistent, both as pupils and
 as part of the Norwegian society. When the national curriculum of 2006 
states as one of the aims in the subject of Food and health to  <i>«Prepare Sami food and account for some traits of the Sami food culture»</i>,
 it is a legitimation and standardization that the Sami minority in 
Norway should be seen in the school, and that it is important that all 
pupils get to know different sides of Sami culture. We will give some 
glimpses of the curriculums in Norway throughout the times and their 
relation to the Sami. 
</p><p>

</p><h3>1890-1922-1939-1960-1974-1987-1997-2006</h3>
In all these years nationwide curriculums for Norwegian primary school 
were introduced. What do the different curriculums state concerning Sami
 culture and the Sami people? The first four curriculums state nothing, 
or practically nothing, neither concerning the Sami or other minorities 
in Norway. All of the curriculums presuppose that Norway is mono-lingual
 and mono-cultural, and mother tongue and Norwegian are treated as two 
sides of the same story. 
<p>
	Maybe one did not know better back then? Maybe no one thought about 
these things? Yes, someone did, and already back in the 1920's demands 
for both teaching in Sami and Sami content in the school was raised, 
among others through  Per Fokstad's Some hints to a proposal of a Sami 
(Lappish) curriculum, which he presented to the Parliamentary school 
commission. The commission's report of 1926 contains a separate chapter 
concerning the Sami and Kven school conditions. Various views are 
referred to in the chapter, among others Fokstad's curriculum and the 
view of the reindeer hearding inspector Kristian Nissen and the director
 of schools Chr. Brygfjeld, who both oppose the curriculum. The 
commission appointed a separate board to consider the question. This is 
how the board rejected  Fokstad's proposal:
</p><p>
	<i>In other words the demand is that Norway should take care of 
developing a Sami spiritual culture, which is still non-existent. One 
could call this a beautiful thought; but it is a thought it is not 
possible to realize. ... The Sami have not developed a spiritual culture
 themselves, through a settled way of life adapted to culture, but only a
 culture which is most closely connected to the nomadic life. One has 
not made experiences that indicate that some other Sami culture would be
 possible to develop at all; the conditions for such a development is 
not there; the entire distinctive character and talents of this people 
are not leading in that direction, ... If one looks seriously at the 
conditions, one would have to say that the Sami in this country hardly 
have any chance to enter the cultural life without acquiring the 
Norwegian culture, first and foremost through learning to master the 
Norwegian language. ...
	</i></p><p><i>
In accordance with what has been stated the commission finds that the 
work in the mixed language districts in general should continue on the 
trail that has been entered upon. </i></p><p>

<td><b> The curriculum of  1939 ignored the Sami completely.</b></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>
 
</p><h3>Progressive pedagogics – not for the Sami</h3>
One of the greatest changes of the curriculum took place in 1939. The 
curriculum was marked by progressive pedagogics, with a greater emphasis
 than previously on the individual activity of the pupil. Nevertheless 
this plan was also written based on the conditions in Southern Norway. 
The Sami and Kvens are not mentioned at all, neither as pupils nor as 
theme for teaching. 
<p>
	The curriculum for Norwegian language starts with the conclusion: <i>«The
 goal is to teach the children to speak their mother tongue naturally, 
easy and clear – without bigger mistakes in sound and grammar.»</i> Once again the fact that the school had pupils with other mother tongues than Norwegian is completely ignored. 
</p><h3>As if nothing had happened </h3>
In the post-war period two important reports which recomended to change 
the school politics concerning the Sami were published. First in 1948 
from the Coordination committee of the school system, later in 1959 from
 the Sami committee. Law of the primary school from 1959 opened up for 
using Sami as a language of teaching. But when a new curriculum was made
 for testing the school of nine years in 1960, it showed no traces of 
this reconsideration of the teaching of the Sami. 
<p>
	Still Norwegian equals mother tongue. Still Sami and Sami areas are 
barely mentioned. In Social subjects the aim among others is to  
«develop tolerance and respect for people of different skin colour, 
language, religion, traditions and view of society». Still the 
curriculum set up for the oposite when it comes to the Sami in Norway 
and the Sami pupils, in ignoring them consequently. 
</p><p>
	Sami are only mentioned in the Geography subject, where one of the exercises for the pupils is:<i> «Recount the content of a book about  a) Sami, b) Eskimos, c) Negroes in Africa, d) Negroes in America». </i></p><p>

 </p><p><table bgcolor="#ffcf77" border="2" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><img src="skolehist/m74.jpg" width="200"></td>
 <td><b> The curriculum of 1974 was the first to contain Sami themes in many subjects. </b></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>
 
</p><h3>The Sami demand changes the curriculum</h3>
When an extensive change of the curriculum was planned in the late 
1960's, the time was more than ready to let the new view on the Sami  
emerge in the curriculum. Still it did not happen without further ado. 
<p>
	That the Sami were mentioned at all in the first report of 1970, was 
because Anton Hoëm, who had done research exactly on Sami school 
conditions, both asked for this from the Basic curriculum committee<strong>, </strong>and
 wrote suggestions for the text himself. A two page chapter on Sami 
speaking pupils in the primary school was then added to the preparations
 for basic curriculum for the primary school .The law of primary school 
from 1969 which states the right of teaching in Sami is referred to 
here. But the committee wants to postpone the questions concerning the 
Sami conditions until the basic plan is finished and later make a 
supplement. The conditions for Sami pupils was therefore postponed to 
the second report from the committee. It did not last long until there 
were reactions. The school council of Kautokeino was in the front rank 
of the critics, which in December the same year among others stated:
</p><p>
<i>«a. The plan does not state that there are Sami speaking pupils in Norwegian schools and Sami culture in Norway. 
</i></p><p><i>
b. The teaching of Sami speaking pupils has not been treated. 
</i></p><p><i>
c. The aim for bilingualism Norwegian/Sami has not been treated, and not
 the difficulties concerning so-called language problems either.»</i> </p><p>
	The critics from Kautokeino was probably one reason that a two-page 
chapter on  «Pupils in mixed-language districts» was added to the 
temporary curriculum of 1971, although the content was far from what the
 critics had wished for. In this chapter it is written that Sami pupils 
can have basic teaching in Sami, but that  <i>«It is reasonable to 
assume that Sami and the Sami culture will dominate in the lowest level 
of the primary school, and that Norwegian language and Norwegian culture
 will substitute this place in the higher levels in the primary school.»
 </i>In the singular subjects the Sami are mentioned directly only once:
  In the Orienteering subject for the 4. year the pupils are to learn 
about <i>«Life in cold areas»: «The Tundra, Greenland, Canada: Eskimos, North-Scandinavia – Sami.» </i>
</p><p>
	Sami school environments strengthened the critics, and joined their 
forces in making changes in the final curriculum. In the spring of  1972
 a great seminar was held in  Kautokeino concerning the draft for the 
basic curriculum and the school situation of the Sami. The statements 
from this seminar were presented to Stortinget's church and educational 
committee. 
</p><p>
	The critics of  M71 (the basic curriculum of 1971) was concerning both 
the position of Sami and Norwegian language in the teaching and the lack
 of Sami content in the singular curriculums. In the first area the 
results were poor. The formulation about changing to Norwegian as the 
main language was kept. On the other hand the Sami subject was taken 
into the curriculum, and several points concerning Sami conditions were 
taken into the curriculum in several subjects. The curriculum states no 
guidelines of what concerns the Sami areas and what concerns the rest of
 the country. All pupils in the country should in principle get this 
teaching on Sami conditions, but without teachers and textbook writers 
who had enough knowledge a lot would often lack that this was followed 
through.

</p><h3>The first Sami curriculums</h3>
In 1984 the Ministry of church and education got the primary school 
council started in working with a new curriculum. Contemporaneously with
 the work with the curriculum, an important change in the body of laws<strong> </strong>took
 place. Through a change in the law of primary school in 1985, Sami got 
the status of language of teaching. Through this change most of the 
changes the Sami school environments had fought for but not achieved 
with M74 had been achieved. But this change did not happen by itself. At
 first there was a great resistance in the ministry. When the Sami 
educational council was founded the Sami school environments were given a
 formal<strong> </strong>role in the school administration which would 
give a stronger Sami influence on the work with the curriculum. During 
the reform of the curriculum in the 1980's the educational council was 
the main force in getting separate Sami curriculums. The first director 
of the educational council, Edel Hætta Eriksen, tells:
<p>
<i>Sami educational council learned that the basic curriculum was to be revised<strong> </strong>and made an enquiry<strong> </strong>to
 the Ministry of church and education in 1984 suggesting to make a basic
 Sami curriculum. The Sami educational council was then asked to make 
curriculums, at first with Sami as first and second language. The 
council agreed, but at the same time demanded that there should be made 
separate Sami curriculums for all subjects.. ... Although we had to use 
the Norwegian curriculum  M87 as our base, it was still the first Sami 
curriculum.» </i>(SSH1)
</p><p>
	In 1989 part 2 of the basic curriculum<strong> </strong>was published 
with Sami curriculums for seven subjects in the primary school. No 
guidelines were stated for who should make use of this curriculum. That 
matter was left to the single<strong> </strong>municipality or school. 
The curriculum was used to a greater or smaller extent in  Kautokeino, 
Karasjok, Porsanger, Nesseby and in two schools in Tana and the special 
Sami schools in Målselv, Hattfjelldal and Snåsa. But even here the Sami 
curriculum was not used completely<strong> </strong>for everybody. Some schools only used part of the Sami curriculum, or they used it only in Sami speaking classes. 
</p><p>
	The national curriculums kept the paragraphs about Sami in some 
subjects. In other subjects the Sami topics were removed and only 
continued<strong> </strong>in the Sami curriculums. Consequently the 
national curriculums, which also the greatest part of  the Sami pupils 
were taught by, had less content concerning the Sami matters after the 
M87 than after the M74. 
</p><p>
	But the curriculums from 1987/89 were not to be used untouched for a 
long time. Already in  1990 a new minister who wanted to remove the Sami
 curriculums completely entered the ministry. You can read about this in
 the next article.
