<h2>Did you know?</h2>
that<p>
- Sami language was medium of instruction in schools almost 300 years ago.<p>
- later Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish and Russian authorities used the school to extreminate the Sami language and culture - and they almost succeeded.<p>
- there were teachers who taught in Sami even though it was forbidden by law.<p>
- while other Sami teachers refused their children to speak their mother tongue.<p>
- there were Norwegian teachers who in the 1950:s called the language policy "a crime against the children".<p>
- in the 1950's there was a Sami vocational training with a Sami content and Sami language as a subject, but later this disappeared.<p>
- Sami pupils in Norway have since 1998 had the legal right to education in Sami language - but many  have not got it.<p>
